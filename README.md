A demake of [Mixolumia](https://davemakes.itch.io/mixolumia). Thanks to the wonderful [davemakes](https://twitter.com/davemakes) for giving me permission to do this!

The goal is to reach level 15 by clearing 450 blocks. If the board fills up you lose.

You clear blocks in 2 ways:
- getting 3 or more blocks of the same color in a straight line
- putting 4 blocks of the same color together to make a diamond

## Controls
‚¨ÖÔ∏è/‚û°Ô∏è
- move current quad left or right

‚¨áÔ∏è
- hard drop current quad to the bottom of the board

‚ùé (z/c/n)
- rotate counter clockwise

üÖæÔ∏è (x/v/m)
- rotate clockwise

Press ‚ùé + üÖæÔ∏è to start the game!

## Drop shadow

Some players find the falling block shadow confusing. If you would rather turn it off, you can toggle whether it displays with "hide shadow" and "show shadow" in the pause menu.

## Links

The full code (broken up into multiple files for readability) is available on github [here](https://github.com/andrewedstrom/picolumia).

Finally, if you like this, *please* go check out the original [Mixolumia](https://davemakes.itch.io/mixolumia). It's gorgeous, juicy, addictive, and relaxing, and the dynamic soundtrack is absolutely amazing. Plus it uses the PICO-8 color palette!
